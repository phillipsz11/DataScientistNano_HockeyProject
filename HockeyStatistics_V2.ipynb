    "Overall, Carey comes in 4th place against these great goalies. Nearly 92 shots out of 100 is nothing to scoff out, but for players like Henrik Lundqvist and Tuukka Rask, they are both able to make that extraordinary effort to save more. I would want to dig deeper into this, like how a team's defense plays into protecting their goalie, or limiting the options forwards can have to set up and make shots. Maybe we would find that Carey's team (Montreal Canadiens) doesn't have as good a defense over this period of time compared to Henrik's (Rangers) and Tuukka's (Bruins)."

    "Hopefully, we see from the above graphic that the model's predictions run close to the actual results from our training/test dataset. I noticed that I would get varying results every time I ran this. Sometimes the RMSE would be as high as 64, and other times it would be 0.2. I tried to include differences in the layers of my model, hyperparameter tuning, and adjusting using L1 and L2 weights, but other than narrowing the gap in these differences, I still wasn't able to get a consistent result. This would require more research and possibly more data or different parameters. Many neural networks training on thousands of records. The problem here with hockey players, most don't play more than 1000 games in their career. This could also be why the model is inconsistent, lack of data."
