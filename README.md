## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and the Tensorflow and Keras packages.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using NHL game Data to better understand:

1. How my favorite player (Carey Price) compares to other goalies in the league?
2. How does he compare to the top five goalies in the league?
3. Can we predict how many goals a player like Alexander Ovechkin will score?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Martin Ellis for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/martinellis/nhl-game-data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like! 
Also, I would like to give credit to the YouTube channel [Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIUxPv5PJOY) for a video on the creation of the neural network used to predict goals. While I did repurpose it and toyed with the hyperparameters a bit, the original code and idea came from this video.
